# Part 1

## Question 1

Create an array of strings called `colors` that contain "orange", "red", "yellow", "turquoise", and "lavender".

Then, using array subscripting and string interpolation, print out the String `"orange, yellow, and lavender are some of my favorite colors"`.
```swift
let colors = ["orange", "red", "yellow", "turquoise", "lavender"]
```

answer: 
```swift
print("\(colors[0]), \(colors[2]), \(colors[4]) are some of my favorite colors")
```

## Question 2

Remove "Illinois" and "Kansas" from the array below.

`var westernStates = ["California", "Oregon", "Washington", "Idaho", "Illinois", "Kansas"]`

answer:
```swift
westernStates.remove(at: 5)
westernStates.remove(at: 4)
print(westernStates)
```

## Question 3

Iterate through the array below. For each state, print out the name of the state, a colon, and whether it is or is not **in the continental United States.**  

`let moreStates = ["Hawaii", "New Mexico", "Alaska", "Montana", "Texas", "New York", "Florida"]`  

answer: 
```swift
for state in moreStates {
    if state == moreStates[0] || state == moreStates[2]{
        print("\(state) is not in the contient of the United States")
    } else {
        print("\(state) is in the contient of the United States ")
    }
}
```

## Question 4

Print out how many non-whitespace characters are in `myString`:

`let myString = "This is good practice with Strings!"`

answer: 
```swift 
let formattedMyString = myString.replacingOccurrences(of: " ", with: "")
print(formattedMyString.count)
```

Iterate through the array below. For each sentence, print out how many non-whitespace characters are in it.

`let myFavoriteQuotes = ["To be or not to be, that is the question.", "The only source of knowledge is experience.", "Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!", "Four score and twenty years ago..."]`

answer:
```swift
var i = 0
repeat {
    print(myFavoriteQuotes[i].replacingOccurrences(of: " ", with: "").count)
    i += 1
} while i < myFavoriteQuotes.count
```

## Question 5

Iterate through `garden` and place any ðŸŒ· that you find into the `basket`. Replace any ðŸŒ· that you pick up with `"dirt"`. Then print how many ðŸŒ· are in your `basket`.

```swift
var garden = ["dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt","dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt"]
var basket = [String]()
```

answer:
```swift
var w = 0
repeat {
    if garden[w] == "ðŸŒ·" {
        basket.append("ðŸŒ·")
    }
    print(garden[w].replacingOccurrences(of: "ðŸŒ·", with: "dirt"))
    w += 1
} while w < garden.count
print(basket.count)
```

## Question 6

The below array represents an unfinished batting lineup for a baseball team. **You, the coach,** need to make some last minute changes:

- Add "Suzuki" to the end of your lineup.
- Change "Jeter" to "Tejada".
- Change "Thomas" for "Guerrero"
- Put "Reyes" to bat 8th instead.

`var battingLineup = ["Reyes", "Jeter", "Ramirez", "Pujols","Griffey","Thomas","Jones", "Rodriguez"]`

answer: 
```swift
battingLineup.append("Suzuki")
battingLineup[1] = "Tejada"
battingLineup[5] = "Guerrero"
battingLineup.swapAt(0, 7)
print(battingLineup)
```

## Question 7

Given an array of Ints, find out if it contains a target number.  

(The built-in `contains(_:)` function will do this, but you aren't allowed to use it for this exercise.)
 
```swift
var numbers: [Int]

let target: Int = 32
```

Ex.1

```swift
numbers = [4,2,6,73,32,4,2,1]

target = 32

//true
```

Ex. 2

```swift
numbers = [32459,2,4,5,1,4,2,1]

target = 3

//false
```

answer:
```swift
var contains = numbers.filter{$0 == target}
print(contains)
```

## Question 8

Find the largest value in an array of Int.  Do not use the built-in `max()` method.

```swift
let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}

//This creates an array of 100 numbers in between 0 and 200. For now, you don't need to worry about how it does that.
```

answer:
```swift
var maxNumberArray:Int = 0
for number in arrayOfNumbers where number >= maxNumberArray {
maxNumberArray = number
}
print("The max number in the array is \(maxNumberArray)")
```

## Question 9

Find the smallest value in an array of Int.  Do not use the built in min() method.

```swift
let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}

//This creates an array of 100 numbers in between 0 and 200.  For now, you don't need to worry about how it does that.
```

answer:
```swift
var minNumberArray:Int = 200
for number in arrayOfNumber where number <= minNumberArray {
    minNumberArray = number
}
print("The min number in the array is \(minNumberArray)")
```

## Question 10

Iterate through `secondListOfNumbers`, and print out all the odd numbers.

`var secondListOfNumbers = [19,13,14,19,101,10000,141,404]`

answer:
```swift
var secondListOfNumbers = [19,13,14,19,101,10000,141,404] //print out all the odd numbers
for counter in 0...7 where secondListOfNumbers[counter] % 2 == 1{
    print(secondListOfNumbers[counter])
}
```

## Question 11

Iterate through `thirdListOfNumbers`, and print out the sum.

`var thirdListOfNumbers = [11, 26, 49, 61, 25, 40, 74, 3, 22, 23]`

answer:
```swift
let total = thirdListOfNumbers.reduce(0, +)
print(total)
```

## Question 12

Iterate through `thirdListOfNumbers`, and print out the sum of all the even numbers.

`var thirdListOfNumbers = [11, 26, 49, 61, 25, 40, 74, 3, 22, 23]`

answer:
```swift
var sum = 0
for counter in 0...9 where thirdListOfNumber[counter] % 2 == 0 {
    sum += thirdListOfNumber[counter]
}
print("The sum is \(sum)")
```

## Question 13

Append every Int that appears in both `listOne` and `listTwo` to the `sharedElements` array. Then print **how many Ints** are shared.

```swift
var listOne = [28, 64, 7, 96, 13, 32, 94, 11, 80, 68]
var listTwo = [18, 94, 48, 6, 42, 68, 79, 76, 13, 7]
var sharedElements = [Int]()
```

answer:
```swift
sharedElements = listOne + listTwo
print(sharedElements.count)
```

# Part 2

## Question 1

Write code such that `noDupeList` has all the same Ints as `dupeFriendlyList`, but has no more than one of each Int.

```swift
var dupeFriendlyList = [4,2,6,2,2,6,4,9,2,1]
var noDupeList: [Int] = []
```

answer:
```swift
noDupeList = dupeFriendlyList
let list = Set(noDupeList)
print(list)
```
## Question 2

Find the second smallest number in an Array of Ints

`let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}`

answer:
```swift
let sorted = arrayOfNumbers.sorted()
let secondSmallest = sorted[1]
```

## Question 3

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

answer:
```swift
var n = 0
for number in 0...1000 where number % 3 == 0 || number % 5 == 0 {
    n += number
}
print("The sum of all multiples of 3 and 5 below 1000 is \(n)")
```

## Question 4

Make an array that contains all elements that appear **more than twice** in `someRepeatsAgain`.

```swift
var someRepeatsAgain = [25,11,30,31,50,28,4,37,13,20,24,38,28,14,44,33,7,43,39,35,36,42,1,40,7,14,23,46,21,39,11,42,12,38,41,48,20,23,29,24,50,41,38,23,11,30,50,13,13,16,10,8,3,43,10,20,28,39,24,36,21,13,40,25,37,39,31,4,46,20,38,2,7,11,11,41,45,9,49,31,38,23,41,16,49,29,14,6,6,11,5,39,13,17,43,1,1,15,25]
```

answer:
```swift 
var repeatsAgain = [Int]()
var a = 0
for x in someRepeatsAgain {
    for y in someRepeatsAgain {
        if x == y {
            a += 1
        }
        if a > 2 {
            repeatsAgain.append(y)
            break
        }
    }
    a = 0
}
repeatsAgain = Array(Set(repeatsAgain))
print(repeatsAgain.sorted())
```

## Question 5

Identify if there are 3 integers that sum to 10 in the following array. If so, print them as a triplet. If there are multiple triplets, print all possible triplets.

`var tripleSumArr = [-20,-14, -8,-5,-3,-2,1,2,3,4,9,15,20,30]`

                triplets.append([x, y, z])
            }
        }
    }
}
print(Set(triplets)) 
```
